Asset - Favor

Favors are a particular form of transaction throughout Creation. A noble asks an academy admissions head to add their child to the incoming roster one year, and that academy then asks a favor in return.

Favors represent a character's connectedness in a different way than having an ear in multiple courts or ranks of spies waiting on their orders.  

A Favor is essentially any other Asset, asked for and loaned more or less at the character's word.
