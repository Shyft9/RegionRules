Asset - Workshop (REVISE FORMULAS)

A Workshop is a facility usually focused around a specific Ability, Specialty, or Dramatic Action. This is deliberately broad, as it is meant to encompass a range of installations such as training fields, smiths, bakeries and temples.

The workshop asset is highly flexible and contextual, relying on a fair degree of player and storyteller arbitration. The ratings below are provided as an example for a craft-focused workshop, which is the most common case. 

X - You don't have access to a workshop, just basic tools. (What to do here?)
* - A rudimentary workshop - Craft Actions capped at 6d
** - A basic workshop - Craft Actions capped at 9d
*** - A Master's Workshop - Craft Actions capped at 13d
**** - Craft Actions capped at 20d
***** - An Ideal Workshop, equipped with First Age Tools and magical devices. Craft Actions capped at 30d.
