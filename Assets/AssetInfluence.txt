Asset - Influence

Influence represents a character's social or cultural pull. This can be derived from any number of sources such as fame, living openly as an Exalt, or being a leader in some fashion. As a general rule, characters who are described as kings, lords, rulers, authority figures and so on have Influence within their Locales if not entire Regions.

Mechanically, Influence is primarily focused on Regional scale play and the Authority mechanic. Characters with Influence generate [Rating] Authority per season within a Locale or Region, which in turn can be spent on Strategic or Regional actions. Alternatively Influence can represent 'potential' power, such as that held by a well-positioned courtier. Authority generated by any source does not accumulate over time, so any left over Authority at the end of a season doesn't carry forward.

Note that Influence is not the only source of Authority, and it stacks with adjacent sources such as controlling one or more Locales, great works of magic, military or industrial might and so on. Such things tend to go hand in hand, but are not inevitably connected.

Example

Tenth Tree Sage has Influence 3 in the Hundred Kingdoms; he can within applicable Locales, spend up to Authority 3 on regional-scale actions, asking various courts and organizations to do what he asks. Alternatively, he can trade his generated Authority for some other kind of benefit, aiding a local power in exchange for a boon or advantage. 

Design Note: Influence is both the 'leadership' asset and the 'Soft Power' asset, in that you don't need to be a king or powerful individual to have the kinds of power Influence provides. Influence is a good way to introduce Regional actions without obligating a character to engage the entire system in one go.
